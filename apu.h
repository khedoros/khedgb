/* 512 Hz frame sequencer, with 8 phases (2048 cycles between phases)
 * - length is clocked on phases 0, 2, 4, and 6 (256Hz)
 * - volume envelope is clocked on phase 7 (64Hz)
 * - sweep is clocked on phases 2 and 6 (128Hz)
 *
 *  Square 1: Sweep -> Timer -> Duty -> Length Counter -> Envelope -> Mixer
 *  Square 2:          Timer -> Duty -> Length Counter -> Envelope -> Mixer
 *  Wave:              Timer -> Wave -> Length Counter -> Volume   -> Mixer
 *  Noise:             Timer -> LFSR -> Length Counter -> Envelope -> Mixer
 *
 * Length counter:
 * - Channel disables when length hits 0
 * - Writing to length loads an internal counter (length doesn't show the time remaining)
 * 
 * Volume envelope:
 * - Volume stays in range of 0-15
 * - if period is 0, or volume is 0 or 15, it doesn't change
 * 
 * Square wave:
 * - Timer period set by 4*(2048-freq)
 * - 4 duty cycle options:
 *   0 = 00000001  12.5%
 *   1 = 10000001  25%
 *   2 = 10000111  50%
 *   3 = 01111110  75%
 *
 * Freq sweep:
 * - freq is freq +/- freq>>shift
 * - when note is triggered:
 *   - freq copied to sweep shadow register
 *   - sweep timer is reloaded (timer count restarts from 0)
 *   - sweep's internal enabled flag is set if sweep period or shift are non-zero, cleared otherwise
 *   - if sweep shift is non-zero, freq calc and overflow check happen immediately
 *     - freq calc performed as previously noted, using the value in the shadow register
 *     - if resulting value > 2047, channel is disabled.
 * - when sweep is clocked, enabled flag is on, sweep period is non-zero:
 *   - if overflow check passes, the new freq is written to the shadow reg, and NR13+NR14
 *   - overflow check is run AGAIN with the new value (and can disable the channel), but value isn't written back
 * - if NR13+NR14 are changed during operation, the channel will switch back to the old freq when data is copied from shadow, on next sweep
 *
 * Noise channel:
 * - timer period is 0->7, maps to these actual timer counts: {8, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112}
 * - Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is a 15-bit reg. When asked to produce a value, bits 0+1 are XORed, all are shifted right by 1, and the XOR result goes to bit 14.
 *   If width mode is 1, the result is *also* copied to bit 6 after the shift, producing a 7-bit LFSR. Wave output is bit 0, INVERTED.
 *
 * Wave channel:
 * - Frequency timer is 2*(2048-freq)
 * - Volume control goes 0->3, and produces the following levels: {0%, 100%, 50%, 25%}
 * - Acts weird if wave ram is accessed while channel is active ;-)
 *
 * Note trigger event (write to NRx4 with bit7=1:
 * - Channel enabled
 * - if length is 0, set to 64 (256 for wave)
 * - freq timer is reloaded with period
 * - envelope timer reloaded with period
 * - channel volume reloaded from NRx2
 * - Noise channel's LFSR bits are all set to 1
 * - wave channel's position set to 0, but "buffer is NOT refilled" (think it means that the samples themselves aren't modified)
 * - square 1's sweep does some stuff (described above)
 * - If the channel's DAC is off (upper 5 of NRx2 or upper bit of NR30 for wave are zero), channel is immediately disabled again.
 *
 * DAC:
 * - controlled by top 5 bits of NR12,NR22,NR42 or top bit of NR30.
 * - takes input 0->15, outputs voltage in -1.0 to 1.0 range (using arbitrary voltage units)
 * - DACs output to both mixers. If the channel's active there, the channel's output is added to that mixer.
 * - The mixers output to the master volume control, which multiplies the signal by volume+1.
 * - Single channel enabled by NR51 playing at vol 2 with master 7 is about as loud as that channel at vol 15 and master 0
 *
 * Power:
 * - Cutting power with NR52 clears NR10-NR51, and denies writes to the registers. DMG allows length data to be written, but other models don't.
 * - Doesn't affect wave memory, or the 512Hz timer count.
 * - On boot, wave ram is random-ish, but tends to be the same on a per-unit basis. GBC consistently starts with alternating "00" "FF" values, though.
 *
 *  Extra info here, for after I have the basics coded: http://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/Gameboy_sound_hardware
